# üéß Audio Production Workflow

## ‚úÖ Current Status

**Liberty Bridge (Stop 1)** - ‚úÖ Complete
- Audio recorded and integrated
- Works in preview and full tour
- File: `/public/audio/Liberty_bridge_sample.m4a`

**Remaining Stops (2-10)** - üìù Pending

## üéôÔ∏è Audio Production Options

### Option A: Manual Recording (Your Voice)
**Pros:** Personal touch, authentic, cost-free
**Cons:** Time-intensive, requires consistency
**Estimated time:** 2-3 hours total

**Recording setup (match Liberty Bridge quality):**
- Use same microphone/environment as Liberty Bridge
- Record in quiet space
- Aim for 2-3 minutes per stop
- Save as M4A or MP3 format

### Option B: AI Voice Generation  
**Pros:** Fast, consistent quality, professional sound
**Cons:** Small cost, less personal
**Estimated cost:** $30-50 for all 9 remaining stops
**Estimated time:** 1 hour total

**Recommended AI services:**
- ElevenLabs (most natural)
- Murf.ai (good for tours)
- Azure Speech Service (cost-effective)

## üìù Content Scripts (Ready to Record)

All 9 remaining stops have scripts ready in `greenville_tour_stops_with_test_scripts.json`:

1. **Reedy River Falls Viewpoint** - "You're now facing the beautiful Reedy River Falls..."
2. **Old Mill Ruins** - "Here you can spot the brick remnants..."
3. **West End Historic District Gateway** - "You're entering Greenville's West End..."
4. **Peace Center Plaza** - "This is the Peace Center..."
5. **Historic Main Street** - "Greenville's Main Street is known for..."
6. **Old County Courthouse** - "Here you have a perfect view..."
7. **Shoeless Joe Jackson Statue** - "Meet Shoeless Joe Jackson..."
8. **Wyche Pavilion** - "This open-air pavilion was once..."
9. **Falls Park Gardens** - "We've come full circle..."

## üîÑ Integration Process (Per Audio File)

When you provide new audio files, I'll:

1. **Add to project:** Move file to `/public/audio/`
2. **Update JSON:** Change placeholder URL to real file path
3. **Test integration:** Verify audio plays correctly
4. **Build and deploy:** Update production version

**File naming convention:**
```
/public/audio/stop-{order}-{id}.m4a
```

Examples:
- `stop-02-reedy-river-falls.m4a`
- `stop-03-old-mill-ruins.m4a`
- etc.

## üìã Quality Standards (Based on Liberty Bridge)

**Audio specifications:**
- Duration: 2-4 minutes per stop
- Format: M4A or MP3
- Quality: Clear speech, minimal background noise
- Tone: Conversational, engaging, informative
- Pacing: Natural speaking speed (not rushed)

**Content requirements:**
- Use provided scripts as base
- Feel free to add personal touches/local knowledge
- Maintain consistent narrator voice/style
- End with natural transition or pause

## üöÄ Next Steps - Your Choice

### Path 1: Continue with Manual Recording
"I'll record the remaining 9 stops myself"
- **Timeline:** 1-2 weeks at your pace
- **Next:** Record Stop 2 (Reedy River Falls) when ready
- **I'll help:** Integrate each audio file as you complete them

### Path 2: Use AI Voice Generation
"Let's use AI for speed and consistency"
- **Timeline:** This week
- **Next:** Choose AI service and generate all 9 stops
- **I'll help:** Set up AI service and batch process audio

### Path 3: Hybrid Approach
"Mix of both - AI for most, manual for key stops"
- **Timeline:** 1 week
- **Next:** Identify which stops to record manually
- **I'll help:** Coordinate both approaches

## üéØ Production Timeline

**With all audio complete:**
- Content integration: 1 day
- Production setup (Firebase, Stripe): 2-3 days  
- Deployment and testing: 1-2 days
- **Total to launch:** 1 week after final audio
