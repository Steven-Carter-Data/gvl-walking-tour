## üí° **Studio Recording Tips**

### **Voice Performance:**
- **Pace**: Slightly slower than normal conversation (elderly-friendly)
- **Tone**: Warm, engaging storyteller (not robotic tour guide)
- **Energy**: Maintain enthusiasm throughout all 8 recordings
- **Pronunciation**: Clear enunciation for outdoor mobile listening

### **Technical Considerations:**
- **Microphone distance**: 6-8 inches from mouth
- **Room acoustics**: Minimize echo/reverb for outdoor listening
- **Background noise**: Critical - will compete with street sounds
- **EQ**: Boost midrange frequencies for clarity on phone speakers

### **Content Flow:**
- **Natural transitions**: Each stop should feel connected to the next
- **Consistent branding**: Reference "Downtown Greenville Self-Guided Walking Tour" in intro/conclusion
- **Call-to-action**: Encourage exploration and sharing in final stop
